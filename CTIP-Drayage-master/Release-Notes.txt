Projects Included in this Solution:

ConsoleDemo - Executable - Sample Application Demonstrating Usage. Includes Ninject open source package for Dependency Injection

Packages - Open source and NuGet packages used in creating the Drayage Optimization Library [Moq.4.2.1402.2112, Ninject.3.0.1.10, Ninject.3.2.2.0, ninject.extensions.conventions.3.2.0.0, Ninject.MockingKernel.3.2.0.0, Ninject.MockingKernel.Moq.3.2.0.0, NUnit.2.6.3]

PAI.Core - Provides basic core objects and their implementation that are accessed across the other projects of the class library

PAI.CTIP.Optimization - Optimization Algorithm
Provides all the supporting objects, methods, and services necessary to transform the supplied list of drivers and jobs into an optimized route schedule.  

Tests - An NUnit Unit Test project that confirms the optimization algorithm is operating as expected and is producing the correct output.

==============================================================================================================

The Drayage Optimizer will produce a solution set that represents the best determined sequence of stops, minimizing the total time for execution based upon Locations, Divers, Jobs and Routes provided to the algorithm.
The solution is built leveraging v4.5 of the .NET Framework.  The optimization class library has a small footprint, and should run successfully on any computer capable of supporting .NET v4.5.
