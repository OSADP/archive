# R.E.S.C.U.M.E
R.E.S.C.U.M.E contains two prototype Connected Vehicle (CV) applications under the U.S. Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT) Dynamic Mobility Applications (DMA) Program.  
The R.E.S.C.U.M.E. project incorporates prototype development and demonstration of Response Staging (RESP-STG) and Incident Zone (INC-ZONE) applications using integrated 
technologies that mutually support each other and comprise an integrated R.E.S.C.U.M.E. bundle that is a key research activity within the DMA program.
The RESP-STG application provides situational awareness to and coordination among emergency responders―upon dispatch and while en-route― to establish incident 
scene work zones both upon initial arrival and staging of assets, and afterward, if circumstances require, additional dispatch and staging.  It provides valuable input to responder and dispatcher decisions and actions.  A range of data will be provided through mobile devices and other types of communication to help support emergency responder vehicle routing, staging, and secondary dispatch decision-making.  The INC-ZONE application improves protection of personnel at incident sites from the threat of oncoming vehicles, particularly where those vehicles are being operated outside of recommended speed, and lane guidance where there have been crashes, incidents, or other events impacting traffic such as stalled vehicles or vehicles pulled over for moving violations.  The INC-ZONE application includes an in-vehicle messaging system that provides oncoming drivers with merging and speed guidance around an incident.  The INC-ZONE application also provides in-vehicle alerts and warnings to drivers in violation of speed and lane closure restrictions, both for the protection of the drivers and incident zone personnel.  Finally, the INC-ZONE application includes a warning system for on-scene workers when a vehicle approaching or in the incident zone is being  operated outside of safe parameters for the conditions.

Configuration
------------------------------------ 
The EVAC impact assessment control files can be executed using TRANSIMS software on most standard Window or Linux based computers with 
Pentium core processers, with at least 4 gigabits of RAM and at least 100 GB of drive space for all scenarios.
Performance of the software will be based on the computing power and available RAM in 
the system.
