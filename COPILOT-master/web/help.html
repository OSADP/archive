The Checks section at the top of Step 3 tracks whether you have assigned applications to all Building Blocks or not, and will turn green to indicate that all blocks have at least one assigned application (Figure 3). The Checks section is more extensive when you are using Building Block subsets that do not all have the same applications, and tracks the subset quantity totals to ensure they match the quantities in Step 2.</div>

CO-PILOT assumes that if multiple applications at a Building Block each require one of a particular component, only one of these components is needed to cover all applications there, with some exceptions. You have the opportunity to Review and Edit in Step 4, if necessary. You can change the Quantities or Default Unit Costs by clicking on the "Modify Costs" link in the upper right corner. The quantity and default unit cost values will then become editable.</div>
                            <div class="italicizedText divParagraph">*Note that if you change the Unit Cost, the CO-PILOT cost estimation module will assume that cost is fixed rather than simulated by selecting costs randomly from a distribution.*</div>

Any component added with this feature will also have a fixed cost. Multiple additional components can be added, if desired. Any component added with this feature can be removed with the “-“ button that will appear after a new component is added.
