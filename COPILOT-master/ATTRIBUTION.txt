Key contributors to the development of the CO-PILOT software, development of the CO-PILOT test data set,
and development of the documentation include:

The developers also wish to acknowledge the members of the Noblis Transportation Research group who provided 
invaluable assistance and details on the technologies and requirements for each of the applications. In addition,
