Version 1.0 
-------------------------------------
Retrofit Safety Device (RSD) kits were developed and deployed on commercial vehicles as part of
the USDOT Connected Vehicle Safety Pilot to gain insight into the unique aspects of deploying
connected vehicle technology in a commercial vehicle environment.  These kits enable
communication with other in-vehicle (commercial and passenger) and infrastructure Direct Short
Range Communication (DSRC) devices via a Basic Safety Message (BSM) and multiple infrastructure-
oriented messages, and various messages related to device security credential management.
Implemented safety applications include Curve Speed Warnings (CSW), Emergency Electronic Brake
Light (EEBL), and Forward Collision Warning (FCW).  Each of the RSD kits includes a DSRC radio
and antenna(s), GPS receiver and antenna, embedded gyroscope, J1939 Controller Area Network (
CAN) interface, human machine interface (HMI), and interface to a Data Acquisition System (DAS).
