                            <p>
                                Connect and Ride (aka C-Ride), developed by the Battelle Memorial Institute (<a href="http://www.battelle.org/">www.Battelle.org</a>), is the brand name for the mobile application and corresponding website that is the outcome of a US Department of Transportation (US DOT) sponsored research initiative officially identified as the Integrated Dynamic Transit Operations (IDTO) Prototype Development project. IDTO is the transit-specific research initiatives within USDOT ‘s broader ‘connected vehicle’ research roadmap that includes light-duty vehicles (aka cars), trucks, buses, and other surface transportation modes. Under the connected vehicle research program, researchers are leveraging current and emerging wireless technologies, and the abundance of information that these technologies can make available, with the specific goal of improving safety, mobility and environmental impacts.                                 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                IDTO’s goal includes expanding a user’s access to available transportation offerings by integrating information from multiple agencies/providers (both public and private), and from multiple modes (i.e. bus, light rail, taxi, carpool) into a single trip-planning application that also includes several other beneficial features.  Primary amongst these feature is the ability to plan, schedule and subsequently ‘protect’ inter-agency or inter-modal transfers using a feature called ‘connection protection’.  When available, connection protection will monitor both incoming and outgoing vehicles, and if schedule deviations occur during a traveler’s trip, requests to hold an outgoing vehicle for short periods to enable a successful transfer will be facilitated.   In addition to this feature, IDTO can also integrate additional providers and offerings, such as demand/response, private shuttle/taxi services, and even dynamic ridesharing components to offer a broad array of travel options.

                            <p>
                                US DOT is conducting this research in order to make informed decisions on future research and investment options in the transit community.  Specifically, US DOT intends to analyze the data captured, examine the impacts and benefits discerned from this data, examine how the outcomes of this initial prototype might scale to a broader or national level, and examine the overall benefits the traveling populations.
