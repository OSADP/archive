# Integrated Dynamic Transit Operations (IDTO) 
Develop and implement a prototype IDTO system in a real-world transit environment, developed and operated with significant stakeholder input (agency, travelers, vendors) 
Generate data that will inform U.S. DOT DMA policy and program direction and which will provide a resource to other researchers and developers through the RDE
Generate technology solutions and institutional models that are compatible with legacy/enabling systems and relationships and which are institutional models that are scalable and replicable
Observe the synergistic potential of the three applications that emphasize dynamic transit operations

Primary Functions:
- T-CONNECT (aka Connection Protection) serves to improve the experience for a transit traveler by increasing the likelihood of making successful transfers, particularly when these transfers are multi-modal or multi-agency. 
- T-DISP (Dynamic Transit Operations) provides benefits to both the traveler and the transportation provider.  For the traveler, T-DISP provides an ability to access real-time information about available travel options, including costs and predicted time, in order to best manage their commute.  For an agency, T-DISP extends demand / response services to support dynamic routing and scheduling, and even add/remove vehicles from service, based on traffic conditions, vehicle capacity, ridership and origin-destination, among other factors.
- D-RIDE takes the concept of traditional pre-planned ride-sharing (i.e., carpooling) and brings it into the 21st century.  It does this by leveraging the positioning, messaging, and computing capabilities of today’s smartphones, and advancing an application that will let drivers and travelers, in near real-time, exchange information about needs or in case of a driver, available space.
